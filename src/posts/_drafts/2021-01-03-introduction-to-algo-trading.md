# Introduction

[[snippet]]
|Almost universally, everyone who works as a software programmer has an innate drive to automate everything - that includes passive income. Every single colleague I asked wanted or attempted algo trading at some point.

As for myself, I spent many years on various attempts and have successfully built a system for my own use. Spoiler alert: it is, arguably, worse than putting your income in a fund, a unit trust, or buying an index stock. But hey, it's cool to learn and having the ability to combine stocks trading with automation.

In this post, I will outline my current approach and how you can implement one yourself. I won't dwelve much into details as they might vary a lot from market to broker to how you want it to run, locally or entirely cloud-hosted.
