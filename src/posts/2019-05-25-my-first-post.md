This is actually my second time creating a personal blog/website. My first was Jekyll-based, which you can find archived on my Github account (it's pretty embarassing to be honest)

With this second attempt I would want to showcase my matured skills - compared to (roughly) 3 years ago, by building this blog almost from scratch in Gatsby, which is now my favorite new framework for static sites.
